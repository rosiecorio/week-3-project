ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I achieved all requirements for this project:
-My HTML form is working and submitting data into my database.
-My project is functional on phone screen size and desktop.
-I have a working GET API route and POST API route.
-I have seeded my database with 'dummy' data, this can be found in seed.sql on my server folder.
-I have also added a delete button to my page and used CSS to apply colour theming and styling to the page.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I made an attempt at creating a functioning like button which would also store how many times each comment had been liked.

ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I struggled to with figuring out the logic to make this work, but I will continue this project in my own time to give me practice.

ðŸŽ¯ What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
I encountered a bug with my delete functionality where the delete button wasn't updating the page.
This was because I had invoked the wrong function inside the delete button event listener.

I also had several issues with the function which generated the comment boxes, but this was just several typo errors inside the code.

The biggest bug I had an issue with was getting my fetches to work once the url was changed from my locahost server to my deployed server, however this would occur even when I hadnt changed any other code so I believe this was just an issue with the hosting website.
